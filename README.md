## üìù Usage

Each Python file contains well-documented classes and functions that can be directly imported and used:

```python
from AdvancedDSA import LazySegTree
from Graph import Solution as GraphSolution
from Dp import Solution as DPSolution

# Example: Using Lazy Segment Tree
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
seg_tree = LazySegTree(arr)
seg_tree.range_add(0, 2, 10)  # Add 10 to range [0, 2]
result = seg_tree.range_sum(1, 3)  # Query sum in range [1, 3]

# Example: Using Dijkstra's algorithm
graph_solver = GraphSolution()
edges = [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3), (0, 2, 6)]
distances = graph_solver.dijkstra(3, edges, 0)
```
